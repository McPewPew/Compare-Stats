****Instalation**** -  
Unzip to a temp folder and then move the CompareStats and BonusScanner folders to your ...Interface/Addons folder.  

As there is a limit on how long a tooltip can be, more complicated items will often not show the CompareStats info (Tier set pieces for instance).  
  
Bonus Scanner version changed to the VanillaRatingBuster version -
